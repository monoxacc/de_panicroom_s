A small family has just moved in to a large 
four-story home.  They are unaware of the 
large sums of money hidden beneath the 
floor of their “panic room”.

CTs:  Prevent the Ts from planting the bomb.

Ts:  Break into the house and plant the 
C-4 inside or near the panic room, which 
is located on the 3rd floor.

-I am well aware of the many inaccuracies that 
fill this map with shame.
